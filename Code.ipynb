    "As the major part of the data is categorical a natural choise for the model is CatBoost.\n",

    "CatBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm designed to work with categorical features. It was developed by Yandex, a Russian technology company, and is known for its ability to handle high-cardinality categorical variables, which are common in real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how CatBoost works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding categorical features: CatBoost uses an efficient algorithm to encode categorical features. It can handle both numerical and categorical features, and it can automatically detect which features are categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building decision trees: CatBoost builds a decision tree ensemble, which consists of multiple decision trees. Each tree is built using a subset of the training data, and the algorithm uses gradient boosting to combine the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values: CatBoost can handle missing values in the input data. It uses gradient boosting to predict missing values, based on the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization: CatBoost uses regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. It applies L1, L2, and gradient-based regularization to the decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early stopping: CatBoost uses early stopping to prevent overfitting. It stops training when the validation loss stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: To make predictions, CatBoost averages the predictions of all the decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, CatBoost is a powerful algorithm for handling categorical data, and it has achieved state-of-the-art results in many machine learning tasks."

    "Our final score is 0.9474488228749293. A noteworthy aspect to investigate is the significant discrepancy between the validation and test scores. One hypothesis is that the dataset was not randomly partitioned. We presume that if the dataset had been randomly divided, the score would have been similar to the validation score, ranging between 0.98 and 0.99."
